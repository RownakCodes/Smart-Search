# Smart-Search
This is a school's database where a file has contents in the format: name#email#dateOfBirth#StudentID


There is a file name : test.txt, be sure to save it in the F drive as the program is made that way. The code 
is designed to read the contents of the folder save it in a 2D array and at first display in in a table on the
cmd Prompt. However, it allows you to search by the name / email / Student Id of a person! As you enter each
key of the input, it gives you real time results.

After wards, the code is designed to ask you if anyone left the school or not and if yes, you're asked to enter
the full name of the student who did, as you enter the name, that index gets deleted. However, I didn't code it 
so that the contents of the file gets deleted to so that it can be used again and again! 

Have fun!
